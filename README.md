  ## Description

  This application allows users to enter credits and debits, and keeps track of the total amount in their budget. This app was part of the Progressive Web App section of the UNC Coding Bootcamp. Starter code was provided, but I was tasked with implementing offline functionality. The app was updated to use IndexedDB, a service-worker, and a web manifest to ensure users could continue to keep track of their money offline. MongoDB atlas is used to store transactions.
